### Introduction

SeeYouLink Virtual Communications Platform (VCP) enables you to easily add collaboration and real-time communication features into your website, web application, or mobile app with a few lines of code in no-time.

It consists of audio/video calling, ephemeral chat, screen sharing, and multipoint conferencing with up to four participants. Users outside of your workgroup or organization can be added with one-time access to the current meeting (no account creation or download).

SeeYouLink VCP works in any modern browser on any desktop or mobile device (iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, Linux). We provide a safe, secure, and private (peer-to-peer, end-to-end encrypted, HIPAA, and GDPR compliant) environment.  It can be easily branded and customized to match your product look and feel.

SeeYouLink VCP is based on open standard [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org) technology and [Open EasyRTC](https://github.com/open-easyrtc/open-easyrtc). Our goal is to enable startups and other businesses to add real-time collaboration features to existing web and mobile apps in one day.
